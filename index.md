Thank you for visiting my personal website! I'm currently finishing up my Masters in Library and Information Science and, with my Bachelors degree in Computer Science, my career goal is to focus on community-centered technology. I have a broad range of technical skills from web development to database design to natural language processing and I'm hoping to work collaboratively on projects where I can direct my expertise for public services.

Feel free to take a look at my Portfolio and CV while you're here.
