This project was designed for the Relational Database Management Systems course which is part of the MLIS program at the University of Washingtonâ€™s iSchool.

This database implementation was meant to mimic the operations that would take place at an animal shelter spread out across three different branches. Some of these operations included keeping track of adoptions and foster homes, resident animal medical histories, and staff management. We created an entity relationship diagram after using normalization techniques. Through Dbeaver and the Microsoft SQL Server, we then used the ERD to create a database with SQL. Once all the tables were implemented, we created fake data to populate the database. This was done through both batch data imports and through SQL commands like the one below:

{% highlight sql %}
INSERT INTO dbo.ResidentAnimal(ResidentAnimalID, BranchID, AdoptionStatus, Species, DateOfBirth, Sex, Weight, SpayedNeutered)
VALUES  (4001, 106, 'Needs Home', 'Cat', '2016-05-11', 'F', 9, 'Y'),
	(4002, 101, 'Adopted', 'Dog', '2017-03-12', 'F', 105, 'Y'),
	(4003, 104, 'Adopted', 'Cat', '2019-09-13', 'M', 12, 'Y');
{% endhighlight %}
