This protocol was a group project created for Data Curation II, a course at the University of Washingtonâ€™s iSchool.

All across the country, local politicians have been trying to limit the freedom to information at public and school libraries by proposing bills that threaten to criminalize librarians. Therefore, we created a protocol and repository that are meant to help curate a collection of open data on legislation regarding libraries and library staff. The intended audience for this project includes members of library advocacy groups, state level policymakers, and librarians living in states affected by strict legislation.

Me and my project partner spent a lot of time learning about common approaches in data curation, such as data packaging, metadata creation using established schemas, and collection policy development. Some technical skills we gained include how to implement tidy data practices in R and data integration.

The final protocol for this project can be found [here][bill-gb] through GitBook and the example repository can be found [here][bill-gh] through GitHub.
