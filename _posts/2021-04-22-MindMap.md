As part of the graduation requirements for Middle Tennessee State University’s Honors College, I got the opportunity to work on an honors thesis with a faculty advisor. This thesis was titled “Mind Map Automation: Using Natural Language Processing to Graphically Represent a Portion of a U.S. History Textbook.” The goal I had for this project was to show how NLP could be used to create a supplementary study tool for students.

Mind mapping is a technique for note taking where an individual jots down details that radiate from a centralized idea (see above for an example). In my thesis, I took sections of an open education resource, OpenStax’s [U.S.History textbook][history-textbook], and preprocessed them using pdfplumber. The next task was to identify key concepts in the sections along with their corresponding properties using Python. This was done through a combination of NLP methods like coreference resolution, text summarization through BERT, and dependency parsing. The results of this approach were graphically depicted in a static webpage using the radial tidy tree example from the D3 JavaScript library.

Through working on this project, I gained more hands-on experience with Natural Language, data visualization, and open education resources.

A full copy of my thesis, which dives further into the methodology and challenges of this project, can be found [here][thesis-copy] on JEWLScholar. Additionally, all the programs and supplementary materials used for this project can be found in [this][thesis-gh] GitHub repository.
