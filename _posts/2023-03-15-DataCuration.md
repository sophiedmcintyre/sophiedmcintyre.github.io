This project was designed for the Data Curation I course which is part of the MLIS program at the University of Washingtonâ€™s iSchool.

The goal of this project was to select a public data set and make a recommendation for what repository would best house the data based on the scope and submission guidelines of the repository. The data set I chose to work with was the [Resource Mapping Data by County][dataset] from the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth and the repository I recommended was the [Child Care and Early Education Research Connections][repo] repository. Additionally, I was tasked with creating metadata for the dataset based on the DataCite Metadata schema 4.4 and a study-level description which contained data form fields based on [ICPSR][icpsr] standards.

This class and project was my first time getting hands-on experience with XML, FAIR principles, and data citation. All supporting documentation for this project can be found on [this][dc-gh] GitHub repository.
